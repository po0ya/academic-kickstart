# Biography
Got my Ph.D. at the University of Maryland, College Park, under supervision of [Rama Chellappa](http://www.cfar.umd.edu/~rama/). I worked on various computer vision and machine learning problems while doing my Ph.D.: attribute detection for mobile phones, face detection, compressed sensing with GANs, defending deep networks using GANs, and explaining black-box classifiers with GANs. Now a machine learning scientist at [Butterfly Network](http://butterflynetwork.com) working with [Nathan Silberman](https://cs.nyu.edu/~silberman/) to make medical imaging intelligent, cheap, and accessible. I try to keep an updated version of my resume [here](http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/~pouya/resume.pdf).
